What if you needed to configure the Spyke API endpoint per model / per thread / per request?

Basically this [comment](https://github.com/balvig/spyke/issues/32#issuecomment-76683394), except even more configurable.

Began as a discussion [here](https://github.com/balvig/spyke/issues/155).

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add spyke-connection_lambda

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install spyke-connection_lambda

## Usage

See the specs, as the examples are very clear!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
